# How to collaborate on an idea: Start typing code and to contribute ideas to the community

Once you have you [annotated to work on an idea] (#) you just have to start working on this. All repositories of all ideas are in [our organization Better Code] (https://github.com/BetterCodeHQ) from which you are also part by [have registered] (#). In case you do not record, check your email, **you must have an invitation to the organization `BetterCodeHQ`**.

Looking around the repository idea which you have written down, **must be called as in Better Code but without description**, ie, the name before the colon in the [detailed view of the project] (). You can also check your email as you have to have confirmation **repository access**

## What do I do once I am already in the repository?

Every idea has a different organization but GitHub has a foundation that is that I'm going to comment, **most projects are based on these guidelines**

* We have recommended the creators of ideas to stop the repository a 'CONTRIBUTING.md,that file can find guidelines on how to contribute and how.

* See the **repository issues**, it is a section in which the originator of the idea must have left unfinished tasks. As an example we show you the issues of the official repository Node.JS:

Remember that the project can be organized in many ways, for example using the new function GitHub Project (something like a Trello in-app), we give guidelines but the creators choose or not to do with your space. Contact them to start working if you find something more confusing. If you are still experiencing problems in this regard do not hesitate to [contact](#).
